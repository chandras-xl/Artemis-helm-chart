# Uninstalling the Chart

# Limitations of the chart
1. ScaleOut of pods doesn't work as the Artemis cluster is created using static connectors. If we try to scale out the pod it will be scalled but it won't be a part of the cluster (The fact that static connectors used is to avoid the multicasting issues on the cloud platforms.)
2. In order for failover and failback to work we need to use persistent storage in our k8s cluster. so If you donâ€™t have any kind of persistent storage inside your k8s cluster, then the alternative is to move your cluster formation of Aretmis to virtual machine I.e as docker image (docker-compose) or run as a daemon.
